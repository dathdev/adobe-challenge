# \#1 - In This Subnet?
Implement a program that determines if a given IPv4 address is in a given subnet. The IP
address is passed as a string representation of a 32-bit unsigned int (e.g., 0x62D2ED4B). The
subnet is passed as a string representation of a CIDR subnet (e.g., "98.210.237.192/26").
The program outputs True if the IPv4 address is in the subnet, and False otherwise.
Bonus points for a program can read address/subnet pairs from an input file and write the
results, in a useful fashion, to an output file, both optionally specified on the command line.
# \#2 - Change of Phone Number
Implement a script to update the phone number embedded in many of the store’s HTML
pages.
Over the years, the content authors have embedded the number on pages using a wide
variety of punctuation (i.e., 800 438-4357 or 800.438.4357) while others used letter
mnemonics (e.g., 800-GET-HELP). Some inserted the US country code, with or without
surrounding parentheses. The store has >50K HTML files, all under an NFS /var/www mount
point shared by all servers.
Your job is to replace all the old number with one version of the new number: 202-456-
1414. The job needs to be done tonight, while the web servers are running. You do NOT
have to convert the new number to the existing format used on the page.
Bonus points for a solution that is implemented as a single pipeline of Linux commands.
# \#3 – Implement an LRU Cache
Implement a web app that uses a fixed-size LRU cache to efficiently serve up imagery
The app exposes a web API that accepts two floats, the first in the range -90 to 90 (Lat) and
the second in the range of -180 to 180 (Long), which are Mars coordinates. The app returns
the URL of an image file of those coordinates on the Martian surface, or one of the standard
HTTP error codes.
This app implements an LRU cache of fixed size (3000), keyed on Lat/Long pairs, which
operates in O(1) to return the requested URL. New URLs are obtained using a library
function GetImageURL(float, float), which returnas instantaneously but at a high $ cost;
implement a stub version of GetImageURL() that returns a random number as a string for
purposes of this problem.
On a cache hit, the app returns the cached URL. On a cache miss, the app obtains a new
URL and caches it, ejecting the oldest cached item if the cache is full. These operations
must occur in O(1).
Bonus points for adding diagnostic API calls to get and clear cache hit and miss counters,
and to track the execution time of each of the three main LRU cache behaviors (hit, miss
when not full, miss when full).
